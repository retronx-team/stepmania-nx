## Development

### Build dependencies

Build dependencies are Python (2 or 3) with `jinja2`, and the following devkitPro packages/groups: `switch-dev switch-portlibs devkitpro-pkgbuild-helpers switch-pkg-config`
Documentation to setup devkitPro packages can be found [here](https://switchbrew.org/wiki/Setting_up_Development_Environment).

**Note:** Release uses a customised FFMPEG [build](https://gist.github.com/p-sam/30b4b535f055e1f9b0eab2dd1ce89fd4)
from the [PPSSPP repo](https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp-ffmpeg) to allow a few more commonly used codecs and performance.

### Compiling from source

Run one of the following commands from the project root to build:

```
# Release
./build.sh

# Debug
./build.sh "debug"
```
